            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>KEep your Meetings in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that never fell, in which you may ſee over all the Meetings that are gathered by all the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> that be out of the power and Life. You that be gathered in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt that never fell, him will you feel in the midſt of your gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and then the Light, Life, and Truth, and ſo look (over all the wickeds) pounds, at the ſeed of God, Chriſt, which was before they were, and will ſtand when they are all gone.</p>
            <p>And ſo never heed the wickeds tempeſt, ſtorm, nor hail, nor his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, nor Inſtruments of cruelty; let the back, and the hair, the cheek and the ſhoulder, be never turned from him; though many weapons be formed againſt thee, yet they ſhall never proſper, for the ſeed Chriſt ſhall raign over all, and will ſtand when they are gone, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were.</p>
            <p>And ſo be faithful unto the Lord God, and be Valiant for his Truth upon Earth, Shewing that ſomthing will oppoſe it, or elſe what need the word valiant be ſpoken; and ſo mind the Truth, (and not the wickeds pounds) and the living way which is Chriſt Jeſus, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fell, nor changeth, in which you may ſee over all <hi>Adams</hi> Sons and Daughters wayes, in the Fall, who doth change. Being in the way Chriſt Jeſus that never fell, who doth not change, in this way you have Life Eternal, in which you ſee over all in the Fall (in which is death) and ſo Chriſt being the way, he that forſakes his way, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes his Life; and he that doth not come out of the way of <hi>Adam</hi> that fell, (into the way of <hi>Adam</hi> that never fell) lives in death. So let all haſte and run for their lives into <hi>Adam</hi> that never fel, out of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> that Fell (and <hi>Eve</hi>) For <hi>Adam</hi> that Fell, is the ways of death, but <hi>Adam</hi> that never Fell is the way of Life, In <hi>Adam</hi> in the Fall is trouble, and unquietneſs; but in <hi>Adam</hi> that never fell, is Peace and Reſt: In <hi>Adam</hi> in the Fall, is ſhadows and turnings; but in <hi>Adam</hi> who is the Living way, is no ſhadows nor turnings: ſo every one in <hi>Adam</hi> that never Fell, Chriſt Jeſus, who never Changeth; the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever, then you are in the living way, in which you all have Life, in Chriſt the Living way, which never Fell; and ſo he's the way, and he that forſakes the way, forſakes his Life. In this all may ſound forth, who hath any thing againſt my way, who never Fell, nor changed. 'Twas <hi>Adam</hi> changed, and <hi>Eve</hi> changed, and their Sons and Daughters in the Fall be in the falling, changing, changeable ways: But who are in Chriſt that never Fell, ſees over them all in the Fall, that turns about with every winde as it ariſeth: And ſo in your way Live all in Chriſt Jeſus, ſo will you feel Light, Life, and Power; that Life which was with the Father before the World began; in that all feed, and in that feel, and that way never changeth with the winds and tempeſt; and the cry is, Haſte, haſte, out of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eves</hi> ways, in the death, Fall, and changes: and run, run, out of them into <hi>Adam</hi> the Life, and the way that never Fell nor changeth.</p>
            <closer>This is the Word of the Lord God to you all, feel the ſeed of God ſet over all that which makes to ſuffer, which was before that which makes it ſuffer, and will be when that is gone which makes it ſuffer. <hi>Spread This Abroad.</hi>
